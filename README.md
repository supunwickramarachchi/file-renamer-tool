## 🧠 What I Learned Building This Project

This was more than just a renamer — it was a **personal milestone** in my journey as a software engineer:

- 🧰 Learned how to structure Python GUI applications using `customtkinter`
- 📦 Applied **object-oriented design** to organize logic clearly
- ⚙️ Improved understanding of **file system automation** with `os`, `datetime`, and `shutil`
- 📊 Implemented a real-time **progress bar** and preview system
- ❌ Built a **safe undo feature** using file backups and error handling
- 🧪 Practiced **user flow planning**, confirmations, and error-proofing

> 🔥 This project helped me gain **hands-on experience with GUI programming**, user-centered design, and real-world file operations — all without relying on frameworks.
